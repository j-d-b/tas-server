# TAS Server ðŸšš
This repository contains the GraphQL API server originally built for the [BCTC](http://www.bctc-lb.com/) Truck Appointment System (TAS).

The TAS end-product is intended to have both web and native mobile interfaces. The backend web server exists in a separate environment (potentially physically) and exposes a GraphQL API endpoint for use by the web and mobile applications.

The `tas-server` connects to a MariaDB (or MySQL) database specified in the `.env` configuration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You must have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (^10.7.0)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (^1.7.0)

### Environment Variables
A `.env` environment variables file must also be added to the project root directory. It must contain the following definitions:

* `PORT`: port to open for TAS API server
* `WEB_APP_URL`: full URL of TAS web app
* `SECRET_KEY`: key used to sign API access tokens
* `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`: URL connection string for the MariaDB database (e.g. mysql://user@bctc-tas.com/tas)
* `MG_FROM_EMAIL`: Mailgun sender email address (email sending)
* `MG_API_KEY`: Mailgun API key (email sending)
* `MG_DOMAIN`: Mailgun domain (email sending)
* `PLIVO_AUTH_ID`: Plivo auth ID (SMS sending)
* `PLIVO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Plivo auth (SMS sending)
* `PLIVO_SRC_NUM`: Plivo sender mobile number (SMS sending)

### Installation
Install dependencies

```shell
yarn install
```

## Usage
To use the `tas-server`, the database must be prepared (with the necessary tables) and the server started. The GraphQL API can then be queried.

The database can be initialized with scripts in `lib/data/setup-scripts/` (used in the yarn scripts below)

* `setup-prod.js` sets up all the tables, dropping any existing data (it will warn you)
* `setup-dev.js` sets up the tables and also adds sample data (also dropping existing data, without warning you)

The entry point file, `lib/index.js`, starts the server (`lib/server/server.js`).

The server can run in two modes: `development` and `production`.

### Development and testing
Setup the database with sample data (clearing existing data; it will warn you) and start the server:

```shell
yarn develop
```

In development mode, the server is run with `nodemon`, which restarts the server any time a file is modified.

You can also start the server without adding/clearing sample data using

```shell
yarn start:dev
```

or just reset the database to only sample data (it will warn you) with

```shell
yarn setup:dev
```

### Production
Setup the database tables (users, restrictions, appts, actions, config) *first time only*

```shell
yarn setup
```

**Note:** Running `yarn setup` will drop all existing database tables (it will warn you and ask for confirmation), so *only run if looking for a fresh start.*

Start the server (with `NODE_ENV` set to `production`)

```shell
yarn start
```

## Querying the GraphQL API
Once the server is running, the GraphQL API will be available at `http://localhost:PORT/graphql`, with `PORT` as defined in `.env`.

For testing GraphQL queries, use GraphQL Playground, available at `http://localhost:PORT/playground`.

**Note:** The playground is available in development mode only.

### JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
Authentication and authorization in the `tas-server` uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/)s in several locations, but primarily as access tokens.

Access token JWTs are signed by the backend with the `SECRET_KEY` from `.env`.

A signed, non-expired JSON Web Token must be included in the HTTP authorization header to access many of the resources.

```
Authorization : Bearer <JWT>
```

Where `<JWT>` is replaced by the JWT obtained from logging in (the `login` mutation).

Verification of the JWT (that it has been signed with the correct `SECRET_KEY`) allows access to all of the queries (`authentication`), though the `userRole` claim in the token is also checked to ensure the query can be performed by that given user (`authorization`).

**Example implementation:** The [TAS Web App](https://github.com/j-d-b/tas-app/) stores the JWT given on login in `window.localStorage` and includes it with every request to the `tas-server` API. *'Logging out'* of the application removes the JWT from storage.

### Unprotected Queries
Certain `queries` and `mutations` can be access without any JWT given:

* `addUser` *- for registration*
* `login` *- obtain JWT*
* `sendResetPassLink` *- if password is forgotten*
* `resetPassword` *- following reset link*

### An Example (with GraphQL Playground)
Log in using a sample user

```javascript
mutation {
  login(input: { email: "jacob@jdbrady.info", password: "dragonspark" })
}
```

This mutation will return a string, the JWT.

Include the JWT string received from the response in the **HTTP HEADERS** section (in the bottom of the playground) in the following form:

```json
{ "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI..." } // string truncated for brevity
```

You can now access all endpoints until the token expires. Let's try out a simple `me` query.

```javascript
{
  me {
    name
  }
}
```

This should return

```json
{
  "data": {
    "me": {
      "name": "Jacob Brady"
    }
  }
}
```

Great; you're on your way.

## REST API and Refresh Tokens
The `tas-server` exposes one REST endpoint, `/auth-token`.

This endpoint will respond with a signed JWT (auth/access token) if the request includes a valid `refreshToken` cookie. This cookie is set by the `login` GraphQL mutation. The refresh token is encrypted and stored on the user.

## Testing
Run the test suite with

```
yarn test
```

Tests were an unforunate afterthought on this project and thus are largely tests of each graphql resolver which make actual calls to the database. Thus data in the database give in `.env` will be overwritten when running tests so please ensure you have a test environment set up before running.

### Linting
Uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/); configuration defined in [.eslintrc.js](https://github.com/j-d-b/tas-server/blob/master/.eslintrc.js).

```shell
yarn lint
```

## Deployment
The production TAS will be deployed using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). `tas-server` is one part of the of the three-piece TAS backend, along with a notification cron and the database.

The full TAS backend with `tas-server` as a submodule is exists as the [`tas-backend`](https://github.com/j-d-b/tas-backend) project. The entire backend is deployed with Docker Compose.

## Docker
The `tas-server` project can be run with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Is is also on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jbrdy/tas-server/).

To start `tas-server`, run:

```shell
docker build -t tas-server .
docker run -p 4000:4000 tas-server
```

The default `NODE_ENV` (set in the Dockerfile) is `development`.

### Production
Set the environment to `production` with

```shell
docker run -e NODE_ENV=production -p 4000:4000 tas-server
```

### Database Setup
To set up the database, `docker exec` into the container running `tas-server` and run either `yarn setup` or `yarn setup:dev`.

```shell
docker exec -it tas-server bash
yarn setup
exit
```

### Persisting Logs
The dockerized `tas-server` logs to the `/tas-server/logs/` directory within the container. I recommend using named volumes to persist this data to the docker area.

For example:

```shell
docker run -v tas-server-logs:/tas-server/logs -p 4000:4000 tas-server
```

Then, log files can be found at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/tas-server-logs/` on the host machine.

### Docker Compose
The Dockerized `tas-server` is exciting when used with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to simultaneously start, setup, and connect to a MariaDB database with a single command.

I've done this, a combined `tas-server`, database, and notification spawning cron process in the [`tas-backend`](https://github.com/j-d-b/tas-backend) project.

## Project Organization
All JavaScript is located in `lib/`

`lib/index.js` is the entry point to run the application. It will start the server express server and expose the GraphQL endpoint. This is run by `yarn start`.

### lib/data/

* Contains Sequelize models and model definitions for interacting with the database.
* Contains database connection configuration.
* `setup-scripts/` contains database table setup code, run by `yarn setup` and `yarn develop`.

### lib/logging/

* Logs to `/logs/` directory (will be created if it does not exist).
* `exceptions.log` contains any uncaught exceptions.
* `errors.log` contains all server errors.
* `combined.log` contains all server requests, server error responses, GraphQL queries fired, and errors.
* `verbose.log` contains everything in `combined.log` with the addition of database queries.

### lib/messaging/

* Contains all email and SMS sending code and templates (If you're updating the frontend colors or logo, you'll have to change these templates too.)
* Email is sent using [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)
* SMS is sent using [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/sms/)

### lib/graphql/

* Contains all GraphQL resolvers (helpers, input checking, errors...) and schema. There is a [**README**](./lib/graphql/README.md) here as well.

### lib/rest/

* Contains all code for REST routes. Currently (and potentially forever), the only REST route is `/auth-token`, which gets an auth token using the `refreshToken` cookie.

### lib/terminal-connection/

* Contains all code related to fetching data from the container terminal. Specifically:
  * Checking validity of container details.
  * Getting container size (for `IMPORT_FULL` appointments)
